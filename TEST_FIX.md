# API Key Fix Test Guide

## Root Cause Identified ✅

The issue was that each component was creating its own separate state instance using `useAIStudio()`. This meant:
- SettingsPanel had its own state
- ChatArea had its own state  
- They weren't sharing the same API key

## Fix Applied ✅

1. **Created React Context** (`src/contexts/AIStudioContext.tsx`)
2. **Wrapped App with Provider** (`src/App.tsx`)
3. **Updated all components** to use the shared context
4. **Removed old hook** (`src/hooks/useAIStudio.ts`)

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
Press F12 and go to Console tab

### Step 3: Enter API Key
1. Open settings panel (wrench icon)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Check console for logs showing API key is saved

### Step 4: Test API Key
1. Go to Chat view
2. Click "Test API Key" button
3. Should show "✅ API key is valid!"

### Step 5: Try Chatting
1. Type a message
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. Should see real-time streaming response

## Expected Console Logs

When you enter the API key, you should see:
```
updateOpenAIConfig called with: {apiKey: "sk-..."}
OpenAI config updated: {apiKey: "sk-..."}
ChatArea: API key state changed: {hasApiKey: true, apiKeyLength: 51, apiKeyPreview: "sk-..."}
```

When you send a message, you should see:
```
handleSubmit called with: {prompt: "Hello...", apiKey: "sk-...", isSubmitting: false}
```

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check API Key Format**: Must start with `sk-` and be at least 20 characters
2. **Check Network**: Ensure you can access `https://api.openai.com`
3. **Check Console Errors**: Look for any error messages
4. **Try Different Model**: Switch to `gpt-3.5-turbo` in settings

## Success Indicators

✅ API key shows in console logs (not "undefined")
✅ "Test API Key" button shows success
✅ Messages send without "API key missing" error
✅ Real-time streaming responses work
